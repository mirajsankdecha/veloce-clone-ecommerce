### :pushpin: Project Background

Our project started with the exciting goal of recreating the Veloce Ecommerce website, known for its trendy oversize t-shirts. We successfully crafted multiple pages, but unexpected challenges paused our progress temporarily. Despite this break, our existing work demonstrates a collaborative effort, showcasing a responsive and visually appealing interface.

Designed as a clone of Veloce Ecommerce, our project aimed to capture the essence of the original platform. We paid careful attention to detail during development, creating pages that mirror Veloce's layout and functionality. The responsive design ensures a seamless user experience on various devices, and our visually attractive components embody the oversize t-shirt niche.

Although our project took a pause, the work completed so far forms a solid foundation. We look forward to revisiting and resuming the project, striving to fulfill its full potential and deliver a high-quality Veloce Ecommerce clone in the future.
